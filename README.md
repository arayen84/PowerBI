### Sales Performance Report

The following screenshots depict the sales performance of a chocolate factory across diverse geographic locations. I leveraged Microsoft Power BI tools to create these visual representations. To produce these screenshots, I utilized a dataset comprising four distinct tables: Locations, People, Products, and Sales. I seamlessly integrated this dataset with Power BI and conducted data cleaning and transformation to ensure it was in an optimal and usable format during the data preprocessing stage.

For data connections and transformations, I made effective use of Power Query. Additionally, I employed Power Pivot and DAX for data calculations and modeling. To generate the visual report, I employed a variety of visualization components, including bar charts, tables, slicers, column charts, cluster bar charts, and line charts.
